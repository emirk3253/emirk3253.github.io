I made a game! It has Sans from Undertale dodging bones on a background of a castle. I'm currently in the process of adding the Megolovania theme in the background. Right now we are working on how to define values using variables. It should be complete by next week. We are currently 1/3 through the semester. It's been fantastic so far, and I've learnt so much about Computer Science. I hope my game can be improved in the rest of the semester. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sans+undertale&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjsoLXUoKTeAhUih-AKHdjwAuMQ_AUIDigB&biw=1920&bih=938&safe=active&ssui=on"> Sans game
