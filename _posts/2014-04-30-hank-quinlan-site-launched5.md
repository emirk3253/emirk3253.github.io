This week, we started to learn how to overlay basic shapes over others. To do this, we simply use (overlay) and the beginning of a line of code. We are still continuing our work on making national flags, although I haven't made too much progress on my soviet flag. I think what I need to work on is probably position the shapes I code, because in truth, the soviet flag isn't even that complicated. Well, now I know what to work on next week.
