This week, we learned how to make basic shapes and colors using the coding language racket, and with this knowledge, we can make world flags. Another thing we learned is that a certain header has a certain purpose. To make a star with a black outline, just copy this code: (star 50 "outline" "black") and put it into this site: <a href="https://www.wescheme.org/openEditor"> and press "Run" in the top bar.
