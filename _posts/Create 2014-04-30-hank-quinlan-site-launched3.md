So, on Monday of this week, we took our Comp. Science midterms, and i got a 15/29 (51%). I did get a lot of things wrong simply because I didn't really look over the questions carfully, but I also just didn't know some of them. We had to make a table showing which questions we got right, the level of the question, and our level at answering those kind of questions. The other reason is that I only studied for about an hour and a half, so I didn't get to go over everything.
