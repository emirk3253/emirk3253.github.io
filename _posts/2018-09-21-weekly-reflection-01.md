I liked making the website, and I look forward to learning more and upgrade it in the near future. I learned how to use .html files, how to customize sites using .css files, and using directories to build pages of a site. The biggest challenge was at first, making the posts, but now I find it simple, and now i can do it easily. My impression of Introduction to Computer Science so far is that it's a pretty fun and educational class.
