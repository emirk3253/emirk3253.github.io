The pakistan flag had a dark green background, and on the left side, there is a white stripe that takes up approximately 1/3 of the flag. In the middle of the green 2/3, there is a white crescent, on a 45 degree angle, and a little above and to the right, there is a white star that takes up about 1/40 of the flag. Some questions that were asked throught the week mostly consisted of scaling questions, like "how can i find the scale of my flag?" or "how can you scale an image to fit the flag?". I would probably make the moon thinner next time, as I did not do this last time.
