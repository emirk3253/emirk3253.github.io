This week we are working on "fenced code blocks, and in this reflection, we need to be able to do that. To do it, we simply add three tick marks to the beginning of each code block, and we can put code in our reflection.```;gt:60 "solid" "green"``` If this code works, then I have learned well this week, and if not, I need to work better. Another thing we worked on is improving our contracts, which can help us later on in the year with other parts of computer science. Applying contracts can help us make different combinations of shapes, like a flag, or a crest, or something with a lot of parts. We have already leanred how to use put image to make flags earlier in the year, and it was actually pretty simple. By applying contracts to our projects, we can simplify the way we create code. For example, the word "gt" above stands for "green triangle", and we can let the computer know this by defining gt as one. (define "gt" (triangle 60 "solid" "green"), and now whenever we type "gt" into a line of code on racket, the green triangle will show up. That's what we did this week, and I feel we learned a lot that can help us throughout the year.
