	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I am a student that goes to the Academy For Software Engineering (AFSE for short). So far in my computer class, I've learned how to make a website using GitHub. My hobbies include looking at memes, making bad jokes, playing video games, drawing, and soccer. I can say that I'm at least average at all of these skills. Anyway, enough about me, who are you? Uh-huh. Oh. Cool! Man, you're interesting. Ok, you can click on a different link to see the rest of my website. Safe travels!</p>
